NeuralNetwork
=============

Neural Network class with backpropagation, arbitrary layers/hidden units, and completely vectorized for efficiency

NOTES: 
- LayerLengths is to be given in the format of a list: [s0, s1, ...,sj,...] where sj is the number of units in the j-th layer. So for example creating a NN as follows:
#from NeuralNetwork import *
